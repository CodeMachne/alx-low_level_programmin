# Malloc Project

This is the malloc project for the ALX Software Engineering Program.

## Description

This project aims to implement a dynamic memory allocation library similar to `malloc`, `free`, `realloc`, and other related functions in C. The purpose is to provide a deeper understanding of memory management and the underlying concepts behind dynamic memory allocation.

## Features

- Implementation of `malloc`, `free`, `realloc`, `calloc`, and other related functions.
- Support for dynamic memory allocation and deallocation.
- Compatibility with various platforms and environments.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, simply clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abangayoma/alx-low_level_programming/0x0C-more_malloc_free.git```

## Usage

1. Include the `main.h` header file in your source code.
2. Compile your code with `malloc.c` to link with the malloc library.
3. Use `malloc`, `free`, `realloc`, `calloc`, etc., as needed in your program.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to submit bug reports, feature requests, or pull requests to help improve this project.
